### CPSC 120

* Lab 7

    Lab 7, part 2 was my favorite because I love Blackjack and learning how to code it was very interesting. It was also my first time writing functions. Overall it was a new and fun lab that was challenging, but very rewardining.

* Lab 3

    Lab 3, part 1 was one of my favorites because I love pizza. It was also my first time coding pi! Overall it was a fun and challenging lab to work on.

* Lab 12

    Lab 12, part 1 was one of my favorites because it was one of the more challenging labs. Even though it was challenging, finishing the lab was very rewarding. The final image was also very nice.
